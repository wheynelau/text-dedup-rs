# Learning points

I intend to write a gist for the additional issues for learning purposes.

- flamegraph: Learnt quite a bit about flamegraph when my initial runs were slower than python. Oof
- Concepts I never knew existed in python: Integer overflow, bytes encoding and decoding, memory reallocation, etc.
- Writing tests for rust code
